## How to run

This file can be used for beginners in the web development World.  
To use it locally, fork it to your repository and then download it to your computer. Use command npm install on the client folder and then do the same on the server folder to download all the modules required by the app. Use command npm run on the client and the server to start the server and display the page (http://localhost:3000/).  
To use it with Docker desktop, you don't need to do the steps above. Use the command: "docker-compose up" at the same level where the docker-compose.yml file is. Docker Desktop must be running before executing the command. Then, go to http://localhost:3000/ to access the application.
